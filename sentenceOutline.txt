Introduction
Accelerators are important drivers for fundamental research, especially at the energy and power frontier.
Electromagnetic fields are best suited for accelerating and controlling particles.
Linear accelerators are simple but uneconomical for high energy.
Circular accelerators require a periodic solution, linearized solution in transverse space is easily understood.
Real accelerators have stochastic, nonlinear, and collective effects, and the linear solution is broken.
Already found the linear solution, we need to look for a nonlinear solution.
Integrable Hamiltonian systems offer good predictive power of the dynamics.
Hamiltonian systems satisfying the Nekhoroshev condition are desirable.
Want a system which can be satisfied with magnetic fields, easy to build.
Enter Danilov and Nagaitsev, start with Courant-Snyder linear system, implies construction as an insert.
End up with linear component plus nonlinear function, long studied problem - Hietarinta
The above constraints yield a number of solutions, in elliptic, parabolic, and polar coordinates.
We investigate the elliptic solution since the origin is a stable fixed point, unlike polar.
Parabolic solution has trajectories which cannot circle the origin, leads to unusual density characteristics. - investigate fields
Prefer Chad's alternative complex parameterization of the system, easier for kick and field expansion.
Simulations of the basic system show large flexibility in selection of poles and large tune spread.
Above solutions ignore longitudinal dynamics, especially chromaticity.
Practically the required potential must be pricewise approximated with imperfect magnets.
Enter IOTA, machine constructed to evaluate the practicality of such a system.
Presented work considers simulations and electron experiments on the DN NIO system.
Supplemental work involving the magnetic field mapping and proton line simulation and characterization are also considered.

Single Particle Simulations - improve story based flow
To evaluate stability and implementation of various nonlinear integrable optics schemes single particle simulations were carried out.
The first verification is reasonable conservation of the analytically predicted invariants.
The simulation is constructed as a series of thin kicks proportional to the nonlinear potential followed by the necessary thin lens.
The variance of the evaluated invariants from tracked coordinates can be compared.
Different compositions of the nonlinear insert were considered.
Equi-phase advance in the thin kicks showed improvements in conservation for a given number of elements.
Equivalent thick lenses showed small reductions in conservation. - consider equi-phase centering
Further extended single particle models to include full IOTA lattice.
Evaluate tune spread and impacts of nonlinearities in matching section of the lattice.
Consider 6-D effects including chromatic effects in nonlinear lenses.
Three basic forms of the IOTA lattice, fully linear, with first order chromaticity including compensation, and with kinematic nonlinearities and exact dipole mappings.
See significant effects on bare lattice chromaticity from the exact dipole mappings.

150 MeV Electron Experiments
Electron experiment consisted of three major thrusts, lattice commissioning and alignment including nonlinear elements, kicked beam turn by turn measurements, and circulating beam measurements with synchrotron radiation monitors.
Lattice commissioning involved LOCO fitting of the lattice to the nominal NIO lattice, some linear element alignment.
Chromatic compensation using orthogonal sextupole knobs indicated misalignment.
Sextupole misalignment adjusted for final dynamic aperture optimization on losses using chromatic null space.
Turn by turn data performed in dynamic aperture scans and dense grids.

IOTA bpms are capacitive "button" style, with 20 of one geometry and one different large aperture BPM.
BPMS have a sample rate of 32 points per turn, digitizer aligns BPMS to location in turn.
Linear fit is applied to raw signal difference over sum for the first 16 sample points.

150 MeV Electron Analysis

To evaluate the full phase space, momentum reconstruction from the tbt BPM data is necessary.
There are two main experimental reasons to extract info, amplitude calibration and nonlinear motion quantification.
Started with 2-bpm, but it ignores a lot of signal.
3 and N bpm methods use phase measurements as the baseline, don't trust linear phase measurements for nonlinear system.
Decided on least squares fit to LOCO matrix results, easy to interpret.
We have a good idea of the linear lattice transfer matrices from LOCO.
Use transfer matrices as the model, tbt position data, and position and momentum at a single point as the free parameters.
Tbt data consists of ~7000 turns sampled in each BPM, a turn defined from the lambertson septum.
The nonlinear insert is excluded from fitting, so turn by turn data is considered from end of insert to beginning.
The tbt data must be "slipped" to consider the causality of the later bpms.
There are nonlinearities in the fit channel, but they are small and incoherent over one turn.
Individual BPMS can be dropped to account for errors, in practice not done automatically.
Lmfit package was used for easy access to error and goodness of fit metrics. 
To provide the least squares residual error, the standard deviation in the last 2000 turns of the sample was used.
In typical nonlinear data sets, the beam has long since decohered and so the tail is tbt bpm noise for a given current.
The effect of a number of preprocessing techniques on goodness of fit was evaluated.
The big considerations were PCA cleaning, BPM calibration, and dropping BPMs.
PCA is a special case of singular value decomposition where the variance for each iterative singular value is maximized.
SVD was initially considered, but PCA should separate dominant modes better.
PCA implementation in scikit-learn is also very fast compared to generic numpy SVD.
PCA is applied to tbt data from all bpms in both planes to account for coupling effects.
High order PCA terms are assumed to be uncorrelated noise and excluded.
Typically, the first 8 PCA terms were retained, sometimes more to ensure no information was removed.
The PCA decomposition is then returned to the original BPM tbt space and fitting is applied.
PCA cleaning demonstrated a significant benefit in the relative reduced chi square goodness of fit metric.
The BPM calibration was based on the LOCO results, BPM rotation and scaling allowed to adjust to best fit model.
End effect of BPM calibrations is beam based individual bpm linear intensity mapping.
BPM calibration showed proportional improvement with PCA, dominated by the oddball BPM.
Similar scale improvements in relative reduced chi squared for simply dropping that BPM.
Dropping other BPMS showed no significant improvement in goodness of fit to linear model.
Fits were performed with uncoupled 4x4 matricies since local coupling was minimized.
Comparison of goodness of fit between horizontal and vertical planes was close.

Proton Line Efforts


Magnet Measurements
To prepare for the IOTA electron run, the octupole magnets were evaluated for alignment.
A three axis magnetic test stand was used to sample the field at predefined points.
Before the measurements, the test stand needed to be aligned to acceptable tolerances.
The scan was performed on a cylinder in the magnet.
The harmonic decomposition of the magnetic field on the circles was used to align wrt. fiducials.
Based on experience with operations on the Octupoles, the magnetic test stand software was improved.
A python class for faster head movement and superior data type output was developed. - add interpretable csv
During IOTA operation, harmonic sextupole alignment became suspicious.
Simple observations of closed orbit with sextupole excitation indicated offsets or field errors.
Measurements of closed orbit offsets using bumps in sextupoles indicated fundamental dipole offset.
A sextupole was evaluated using the test stand afterward.
Dipole error was demonstrated to be independent of hysteresis.
Harmonic evaluation wrt. current suggested fundamental multipole error.
Coil turns not suspected, suggested to be uncontrolled differences in relative permeability of poles.
Next generation nonlinear insert to be magnetically evaluated using test stand.
