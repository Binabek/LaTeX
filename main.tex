%\abstract{The stable transport of charged particle beams is the core challenge in designing and operating accelerators. The current paradigm for transverse focusing is based on quadrupole and dipole elements, described as a linear integrable Hamiltonian by Courant and Snyder. The operational limits of high intensity accelerators are often determined by collective instabilities within the beam. Nonlinear elements may be added to suppress certain forms of these collective effects, but restrict the range of stable trajectories. These shortcomings motivate extending to a nonlinear integrable system which can offer the benefits of suppressing collective instabilities without limiting the stable trajectories. Danilov and Nagaitsev proposed a novel nonlinear integrable system with elliptical potentials, which could be implemented as magnetic elements in an accelerator. \\ Such a system has been implemented for practical verification in the integrable optics test accelerator (IOTA), a small storage ring constructed for beam dynamics studies. Electron beam studies in IOTA treat the low-emittance beam as a macroparticle for detailed probing of the expected single particle dynamics. This dissertation details new measurements of the nonlinear integrable system relevant for practical implementation. Turn-by-turn measurements of the kicked beam responses are used for phase space reconstruction and analysis of the predicted nonlinear dynamics. The stability and aperture for various nonlinear configurations are measured with beam losses. Amplitude dependent detuning, a core figure of merit for suppressing instabilities, is measured and compared with high fidelity particle tracking simulations. The synchrotron radiation images of circulating beam allow direct measurements of the topology and lifetime in configurations where nonlinear focusing terms dominate.}
