\section{Background}
Charged particle accelerators have been productive experimental tools for fundamental physics experiments, from rutherfords use of natural acceleration of alpha particles for the discovery of the nucleus to the contemperary multinational physics collaborations centered at the Large Hadron Collider. "Maybe add other physics discoveries" In addition to their useful nature as tools, particle accelerators provide an interesting system to study dynamics in a controlled environment. These same dynamical studies then have direct impacts on the construction of new machines for fundamental studies. As the experiments drive increasing energy and power demands on the beams, careful control of losses becomes more important.
